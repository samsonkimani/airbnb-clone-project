## ‚ôªÔ∏è UI Component Patterns

Planned components for reusable and scalable UI:

- **Navbar:** Responsive top navigation with links to main pages
- **Property Card:** Compact, reusable card showing image, price, title, location
- **Footer:** Informational footer with links, contact, and social icons
- **Search Bar:** Input with filter options (location, date, guests)
- **Booking Form:** Secure form for reservation and payment
- **Button:** Multiple variants (primary, secondary, disabled)
- **Modal:** Reusable popup for login, confirmation, etc.

Each component will follow modular, atomic design principles to allow flexibility and reusability across the app.
